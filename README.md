# Jenkinsfile

The Jenkinsfile to run E2E tests from [cypress-demo](https://github.com/HuitingHuang/cypress-demo.git)

The Jenkins pipeline can be parameterized to decide:
<br>- on which browser to run tests
<br>- which spec files to run filtered by file path
<br>- which test suites to run filtered by tags
<br>- how many parallel jobs running at the mean time
